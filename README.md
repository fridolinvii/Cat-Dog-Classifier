### Cat-Dog Classification using Pytorch

This is a common computer vision project to classifier images whether it is cat or dog. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use convolution neural network (CNN) for classification using Pytorch.

### Data
The data can be downloaded Download dataset from here https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/Cat_Dog_data.zip
Extract it to the data folder. 

### Installations

Create a new environemt and install the required python packages with the command
```

pip3 install -r requirement.txt

```

### Usage

To train the network use

```
python3 train.py
```
and to test the performance of the network use
```
python3 test.py
```
